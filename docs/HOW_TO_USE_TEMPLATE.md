# How to Use the IEEE Word Template

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for transferring your paper draft content into the IEEE Word template.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Word (2010 or later recommended)
- IEEE Conference Paper Template (typically `IEEE_Conference_Template.doc` or `.docx`)
- Your paper draft content

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Download the IEEE Template

1. Download the official IEEE conference paper template from [IEEE Template Selector](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)
2. Select "Conference" as the publication type
3. Choose "Word" as the format
4. Save the template file to your local machine

### 2. Open the Template

1. Open the IEEE template file in Microsoft Word
2. **Do not** modify the template file directly - save a copy with your paper's name first
3. Save as: `sentiment_analysis_decision_tree_paper.docx`

### 3. Update Paper Metadata

Replace the template placeholders with your paper information:

- **Title**: Enter your paper title in Title Case
- **Authors**: List all authors with their affiliations
- **Affiliations**: Include department, institution, city, and country
- **Email addresses**: Add corresponding author email(s)

### 4. Transfer Content Section by Section

#### Abstract
1. Locate the Abstract section in the template
2. Copy your abstract text (150-250 words recommended)
3. Paste and format according to template style
4. Ensure it's a single paragraph with no citations

#### Keywords
1. Add 4-6 relevant keywords
2. Separate with commas or semicolons as specified in the template

#### Introduction
1. Copy your introduction content
2. Paste into Section I (Introduction)
3. Verify that citations are properly formatted (IEEE style: [1], [2], etc.)

#### Methodology/Related Work
1. Transfer each section maintaining the IEEE heading style
2. Use the template's heading formats (I., II., A., B., 1), 2), etc.)
3. Ensure subsections follow the proper hierarchy

#### Results and Discussion
1. Insert figures and tables using IEEE formatting
2. Reference figures as "Fig. 1" and tables as "TABLE I"
3. Place figure captions below figures
4. Place table captions above tables

#### Conclusion
1. Copy your conclusion section
2. Ensure it summarizes key findings and future work

### 5. Format Figures and Tables

#### For Figures:
```
1. Insert the figure image
2. Center align the figure
3. Add caption below: "Fig. 1. Caption text here."
4. Use 8-10pt font for captions
5. Ensure figures are high resolution (minimum 300 DPI for print)
```

#### For Tables:
```
1. Insert table using Word's table function
2. Center align the table
3. Add caption above: "TABLE I\nTABLE CAPTION HERE"
4. Use the template's table style
5. Keep tables simple and readable
```

### 6. Format References

1. Scroll to the References section at the end
2. Use IEEE reference style:
   - Journal: [1] A. Author, "Title," *Journal Name*, vol. X, no. Y, pp. ZZ-ZZ, Month Year.
   - Conference: [2] B. Author, "Title," in *Proc. Conference Name*, City, Country, Year, pp. ZZ-ZZ.
   - Book: [3] C. Author, *Book Title*. City: Publisher, Year.
3. Number references in order of appearance [1], [2], [3]...
4. Ensure all references are cited in the text

### 7. Check Formatting Requirements

- **Page Limit**: Verify conference page limits (typically 6-8 pages)
- **Fonts**: 
  - Title: 24pt, bold
  - Author names: 11pt
  - Abstract: 9pt italic
  - Body text: 10pt
  - Section headings: 10pt bold
- **Margins**: Use template defaults (typically 0.75" all around)
- **Columns**: Two-column format (automatic in template)
- **Line Spacing**: Single spacing

### 8. Review Mathematical Equations

1. Use Microsoft Word Equation Editor (Insert → Equation)
2. Number equations on the right: (1), (2), (3)...
3. Center align equations
4. Define all variables after first use

### 9. Proofread and Validate

- [ ] Check spelling and grammar
- [ ] Verify all citations appear in References
- [ ] Ensure all figures and tables are referenced in text
- [ ] Confirm author information is correct
- [ ] Review that all sections follow IEEE format
- [ ] Check that page count meets requirements
- [ ] Verify no text overlaps with headers/footers

### 10. Final Steps

1. Save your document
2. Export as PDF (File → Save As → PDF)
3. Check the PDF for formatting issues
4. Verify all fonts are embedded
5. Ensure all hyperlinks work (if applicable)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Text doesn't fit in two columns
**Solution**: Reduce figure sizes, tighten writing, or use smaller fonts for captions

### Issue: References not formatting correctly
**Solution**: Use IEEE reference style exactly as shown in template examples

### Issue: Equations break across columns
**Solution**: Resize equation or place in single-column format at top/bottom of page

### Issue: Figures appear in wrong location
**Solution**: Use "In line with text" wrapping and manual placement

## Tips for Success

- Start with the template from the beginning rather than copying everything at once
- Work section by section to maintain formatting
- Save frequently and keep backup copies
- Use Word's styles feature to maintain consistency
- Review IEEE formatting guidelines before final submission

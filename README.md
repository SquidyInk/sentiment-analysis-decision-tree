# Sentiment Analysis using Decision Tree Classifier

**CSC 108 - Project 2: Final Project**

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** for **Sentiment Analysis** as part of CSC 108 coursework. The goal is to analyze text data and classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) using supervised learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and explain the theoretical foundations of Decision Tree algorithms
- Implement the algorithm using a real-world sentiment analysis dataset
- Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations
- Analyze time and space complexity using Big-O notation
- Apply the model to solve real-world sentiment classification problems
